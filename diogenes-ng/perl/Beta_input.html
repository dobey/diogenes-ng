    <h1>Typing Greek in BETA code</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>NB.</strong>  There are disadvantages to using Latin
      transliteration to input Greek -- especially in searching
      corpora that mix Latin and Greek texts, where Diogenes may not
      be able to guess which language you mean.  Unicode input is preferred.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you work with the transliteration employed natively by the
      <i>TLG</i>, the so-called BETA code, your searches must
      stipulate accents.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this scheme, you <b>must</b> indicate accents and breathings
      in the normalized form used by the <i>TLG</i> word list: do not
      indicate upper-case letters, and do not use barytone accents.
      You may use lower-case Latin letters.  Thus the Attic nominative
      singular of Herakles would be "<tt>&nbsp;h(raklh=s&nbsp;</tt>",
      and the oblique and variant forms would be found with
      "<tt>&nbsp;h(rakl</tt>".  Remember that words appearing in all
      upper-case Greek will not usually have dicritics, so to pick up
      titles, etc., you will also need to try
      "<tt>&nbsp;hraklhs&nbsp;</tt>" (note the leading and trailing
      spaces to indicate the start and end of a word).  You may not
      use Perl regular expression metacharacters, because many of them
      are significant in Beta code; your pattern will be turned into a
      regular expression that allows hyphenation to intervene.
