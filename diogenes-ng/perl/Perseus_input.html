      <h1>Typing Greek in Latin transliteration (Perseus-style)</h1>

      <p><strong>NB.</strong>  There are disadvantages to using Latin
      transliteration to input Greek -- especially in searching
      corpora that mix Latin and Greek texts, where Diogenes may not
      be able to guess which language you mean.  Unicode input is preferred.
      </p>
      
      <p> The transliteration adopted by the <a
      href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu">Perseus Project</a> may be
      used to search for Greek text without regard to accents.  In
      this scheme, you should not indicate accents or upper-case
      letters in the words you are searching for; consonants are
      rendered by their phonetic equivalent; and eta and omega are
      distinguished from epsilon and omicron by the use of a
      circumflex accent (&ecirc;, &ocirc;) if your keyboard can manage
      them, or by placing a caret after the vowel (e^, o^).  Rough and
      smooth breathings are distinguished; put "h" in front of a word
      to indicate a rough breathing.  This transliteration scheme
      cannot distinguish between the presence of a smooth breathing
      and the absence of a breathing mark.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may use a limited subset of Perl
      regular expressions in your input; see <a
      href="regexp_info.html">further info</a>.

      Thus a search for the hero Herakles would be performed by
      entering the word "<tt>&nbsp;he^rakle^s&nbsp;</tt>" for the
      nominative case only, or "<tt>&nbsp;he^rakl</tt>" to add the
      oblique cases (note the leading and trailing spaces to indicate
      the start and end of a word).
