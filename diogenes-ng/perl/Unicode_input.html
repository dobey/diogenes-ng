      <h1>Typing Greek via Unicode</h1>

      <h2>Unicode</h2>

      <p>
        Unicode is now the standard means of digital representation of
        Ancient Greek.  Your computing platform or operating system
        should provide a built-in and easy to use keyboard for
        entering Greek Unicode.  Note that it is not always necessary
        to install and use a <i>polytonic</i> or <i>Ancient Greek</i>
        Unicode keyboard.  As explained below, you should not type in
        any accents at all unless you want to specify all of them.  So
        for some types of loosely-matching query, which will match
        regardless of accentuation, a modern Greek Unicode keyboard
        may be sufficient.  On the other hand, you may want to
        indicate breathings, or you may wish to specify all accents.
        In that case you will need a Unicode polytonic keyboard.
        In any case, make sure that you are using a Unicode keyboard
        (not all Greek keyboards are Unicode).
      </p>
     
      <h2>Unicode input</h2>
      <p>
        The main issue to be aware of is that of entering accents and
        breathings.  In general, it is best to start by not typing
        these, and only add them when you need them for
        disambiguation.

        If you type in even one accent in a long phrase, then Diogenes
        switches to strict accent matching.  The only variation that
        is allowed for in strict mode is between acute and grave at
        the end of the word.  But words often appear without accents,
        for example when a whole word is capitalized as part of a
        heading, and so in strict mode your accented pattern would not
        match these.

        It is best to start without breathings too, for these also
        fail to appear in capitalized headings and when the word is
        the second half of a compound, and so on.

        If you want to mark the beginning or end of a word, do so with
        spaces before and/or after the word you type in.  Thus
        "ανθρωποσ" will match πολυάνθρωπος, but "&nbsp;ανθρωποσ" will not.

      <h3>no accents, loose matching</h3>

      <p>
        If you want to search for words regardless of accents and
        breathings fall, do not use any diacritics.  You may use
        breathing marks (optionally, on initial vowels only) without
        switching to strict mode for accent.  All searches are
        case-insensitive, so to search for forms of "Heracles", you
        could search for <tt>"&nbsp;ἡρακλ"</tt>.  Note the space at
        the front of the pattern to indicate a word-boundary.
      </p>
      
      <h3>with accents, strict matching</h3>

      <p>
        If you want to specify accents, then use a polytonic Greek
        Unicode keyboard to type in <i>all</i> accents and
        breathings.  If Diogenes sees a single accent in your query,
        it switches to strict matching, so it's all or nothing.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Latin Transliteration Schemes</h2>
      <p>
        If you cannot manage to enter Unicode Greek text on your
        computer, Diogenes supports two schemes for typing in Greek
        words via Latin transliteration: <a
        href="Perseus_input.html">Perseus-style</a> (loose matching)
        and <a href="Beta_input.html">Beta-style</a> (strict
        matching).
